## Andrew Milne Online Resume

Former Senior Director, Technology Specialist at CME Group, and Senior Lead, Optimization Solutions at 1QBit (Quantum Computing and Artificial Intelligence). I have also held management positions at Sony, Reciprocal (AT&T a2b music), N2K Music Boulevard, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. 

My academic background is in physics and electrical engineering. This makes me partly an explorer and partly a builder, mostly of software and systems.  

Most problems in finance and engineering can be tackled mathematically.  Their solutions almost always involve computation and the design of algorithms.     

I can bring leadership to all stages of the software development life cycle, in both classical and quantum computing: market analysis, data science, technology evaluation. enterprise architecture, visioning, requirements, specifications (classic waterfall, RUP, agile), software architecture, use case models, test design, planning, staffing, coaching, code development, integration, QA, deployment, documentation, product marketing and (that vital step), applying for patents and R&D tax credits.  

## EXPERIENCE


### Senior Lead, Optimization Solutions (Finance Products), 1QB Information Technologies (1QBit)

October 2015 to November 2022

1QBit was founded in 2012 to develop software for quantum computing and machine learning. The company was privately held by a group of strategic investors, including Accenture, Allianz, CME Group, Fujitsu, NatWest and the Siam Commercial Bank.

  - Responsible for product strategy, marketing, sales, and general operations in finance products, as well as for ongoing R&D. Led the company’s adoption of 5C market analysis, product roadmapping, agile requirements, and other process improvements.

  - Created 1QBit’s first commercial product, the CME Market Sentiment Meter, in collaboration with CME Group Chief Economist Blu Putnam. A 100% cloud-native predictive modeling data service sold through CME DataMine, for NYMEX energies, S&P 500 -e-minis (ES), Treasuries, gold, corn, soybeans and bitcoin (BTC) futures.

 - Created the 1QBit Academic Collaboration Program in Finance, the company's most successful market development initiative for quantum computing. Supervised the analysts that guided mid-career Masters in Finance students in classical and quantum projects at UCL, University of California Berkeley, Stevens, and other top universities (8 dissertations in 2 years of operation).

  - Implemented quantum computing solutions for swap netting, clique analysis in forwards markets, feature selection in credit scoring, and position allocation for risk management and capital efficiency (OTC vs. centrally-cleared Eurodollar futures)
 
  - Successfully hired and coached Mitacs interns (Canadian Govt. funding) for work in quantum finance applications, achieving 1QBit business goals at a much lower cost.
