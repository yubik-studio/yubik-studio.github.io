### Innovation Delivered
Welcome to yubik.com, the home website for  **Andrew Milne, MASc, P.Eng.,** offering some personal thoughts on innovation and delivery.

**Delivery is a key milestone in successful innovation,** but it's often a step in a much larger process. 

I sometimes get asked if it's possible to **help people become more creative.**  I have attended workshops in some companies, and given workshops in others.  I'm hoping to make some of this material available through this site. Programs like *Six Characters Meet Seven Principles* have never been delivered in a context where I had to give up my rights as an author.  The answer is yes, but...

I have often been tasked with evaluating the work of other inventors.  I have stood in front of product committees more than once, and been in presentations to investors.  I know how it feels on both sides of the table.  

**Delivering innovation is mostly about persistence and encouragement.**  There's no shortage of inspirational quotes on this, but I'll end with this thought.  Most people are inherently creative.  It's just that getting out ideas in front of others is not always easy. Neither is coping with rejection (after rejection, after rejection...). 

As a team leader, I put a lot of effort into coaching people on their presentation skills, and I do my best in meetings to ensure that every voice is heard.  For some reason, I've been surrounded for most of my career by very creative people.  I don't think it's entirely a matter of luck.
