### Innovation Delivered

Delivery is a key milestone in successful innovation, but it's usually just the first step in a much larger process. 

  - Understanding the process is helpful.  The studios and systems that I designed for CBC were used to produce radio and television programs for broadcast to the public. A good design can make production easier or cheaper, but the viewers are mostly impressed by what they see and hear. A video server that can pull B-roll footage from an archive may be quicker and more convenient than sending a PA to the tape library, but before the piece can be created, the journalists and producers must first assemble the story in their minds.  

  - Empathy for the people inside the process is essential.  It can often take a lot of imagination to bring in a "simple" project on-time and on-budget.  We often begin with a concept of the end-users' needs that turns out to be wrong, no matter how many meetings and sign-offs we've had along the way. 

  - The process sometimes goes on longer than we  think.  The world of patents and intellectual property is not as dry and impersonal as it might look. Like many inventors, I've worked closely with IP lawyers and (on occasion) directly with USPTO patent examiners. However, at AT&T and later at Sony, I had the privilege of learning from top-level IP strategists and rights managers. I don't want to draw too close a parallel between outfitting a studio and earning patent grants, but a lot of action takes place long after the inventor has moved on.

I sometimes get asked if it's possible to **help people become more creative.**  I have attended workshops in some companies, and given workshops in others.  I'm hoping to make some of this material available through this site. Programs like *Six Characters Meet Seven Principles* have never been delivered in a context where I gave up my rights as an author.  The answer is yes, but...

It has often been my task to evaluate the work of other inventors.  I ran the Evaluation Lab at CBC Engineering when it was still on _Cote Saint-Luc_ Road in Montreal.  I've sat on committees that decided the fate of new project proposals.  I've also done technical due diligence for the Strategic Investment Team at at CME Group, which is partly how I ended up at 1QBit.  

I've stood in front of product committees more than once.  I've been in presentations to investors.  I know exactly how it feels on both sides of the table.  _Nemawashi_ is a concept I've taken to heart.

**Delivering innovation is mostly about persistence and encouragement.**  There's no shortage of inspirational quotes on this, but I'll end with this thought.  Most people are inherently creative.  It's just that getting out ideas in front of others is not always easy. Neither is coping with rejection. As a team leader, I put a lot of effort into coaching people on their presentation skills, and I do my best in meetings to ensure that every voice is heard.  For some reason, I've been surrounded for most of my career by very creative people.  I don't think it's entirely a matter of luck.
